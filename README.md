# movie_app

## NOTE
the app name is movie_app it was only tested on an android device 
and should be used on one 

i subimted my apk file but i haven't tested it
due to time, there might be bugs.

I couldn't add a cast and crew in the movie details 
screen because the api doesn't provide it.


## Please Read 
Scroll to see every movie category and the scrolling is also animated 
and each movie is clickable 
 

## Get Started

in yur terminal run flutter run
the app will start 
it might take a moment before 
the data is fetched from the api 
depending on your internet conection
